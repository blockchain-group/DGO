# DIRECTGO
**DIRECTGO**: A new **DIRECT**-type `MATLAB` toolbox for derivative-free **G**lobal **O**ptimization

---

## Quick overview

The sequential and parallel implementations of various DIRECT-type algorithms. The toolbox consists of two main parts:

- **DIRECTGO.mltbx** - `MATLAB` toolbox package containing implementations of DIRECT-type algorithms, including an extensive [DIRECTGOLib](https://github.com/blockchain-group/DIRECTGOLib) library (maintained separetely) of the box, generally constrained, and practical engineering global optimization problems, often used for benchmarking DIRECT-type algorithms.
- **DIRECTGO.mlappinstall** - A single `MATLAB` app installer Ô¨Åle containing everything necessary to install and run the **DIRECTGO** toolbox, including a graphical user interface (GUI).

Additionally, we provide source files of all implemented algorithms in [Algorithms/](Algorithms/) folder.

## Quick user guide

After installation of the `MATLAB` toolbox (using **DIRECTGO.mltbx**), all implemented DIRECT-type algorithms and test problems can be freely accessed in the command window of `MATLAB`. Unlike using GUI, algorithms from the command line require more programming knowledge, and configurations must be done manually. All algorithms can be run using the same style and syntax:

```matlab
1. f_min = algorithm(P);
2. f_min = algorithm(P, OPTS);
3. f_min = algorithm(P, OPTS, D);
4. [f_min, x_min] = algorithm(P, OPTS, D);
5. [f_min, x_min, history] = algorithm(P, OPTS, D);
```

The left side of the equations specifies the output parameters. After the termination, the algorithm returns the best objective value `f_min`, solution point `x_min`, and history of the algorithmic performance during all iterations `history`. The information presented here is: the iteration number, the total number of objective function evaluations, the current minimal value, and the total execution time.

On the right side, the algorithm name `algorithm` and at least one input parameters are needed to specify. The first one is the problem structure `P` consisting of an objective function:

```matlab
>> P.f = 'objfun';
```

If the problem involves additional constraints, they also must be specified:

```matlab
>> P.constraint = 'confun';
```

The second parameter is an optional variable `OPTS` to customize the default settings. The last parameter is the bound constraints for each dimension/variable:

```matlab
D (i,1) ‚â§ x_i ‚â§ D (i,2), i = 1...n;
```

The latter `D` parameter is necessary for the algorithm, but can be passed to it in other ways.


### Example of box constrained global optimization algorithm usage

---

Any DIRECT-type algorithm in the **DIRECTGO** toolbox can be called in `MATLAB` using the same sequences, which are discussed earlier. Let‚Äôs consider the example using the *PLOR* algorithm, solving **Bukin6** test function. Figure 1. (left side) shows the **Bukin6** test function plot over its domain. The function should be defined as:

```matlab
function y = Bukin6(x)                 % Extract info from the function
    if nargin == 0
        y.nx = 2;                      % Dimension of the problem
        xl = [-15; -3];
        y.xl = @(i) xl(i);             % Lower bounds for each variable
        xu = [5; 3];
        y.xu = @(i) xu(i);     	       % Upper bounds for each variable
	      y.fmin = @(nx) get_fmin(nx);   % Known solution value
        y.xmin = @(nx) get_xmin(nx);   % Known solution point
        return
    end
    if size(x, 2) > size(x, 1)         % If x is a row transpose to column 
        x = x'; 
    end
    term1 = 100*sqrt(abs(x(2) - 0.01*x(1)^2));
    term2 = 0.01*abs(x(1) + 10);
    y = term1 + term2;                 % Return function value at x
end

function fmin = get_fmin(~)
    fmin = 0;
end

function xmin = get_xmin(~)
    xmin = [-10; 1];
end
```

Each test problem in the **DIRECTGOLib** stores the information about the problem structure together with the objective function. In this case, in the `Bukin6.m` file, the following information is stored: i) the dimensionality of the problem; ii) the lower and upper bounds for each variable; iii) the objective function value of the known solution; iv) the solution point.
The optimization problem is passed to the algorithm as part of a `P` structure. For a simple, box-constrained problem like this, only one field of the `P` structure is needed:
For some problems, the optimum might depend on the number of variables, therefore the solution values and points are returned as functions for all test problems in **DIRECTGOLib**.

```matlab
¬ª P.f = 'Bukin6';
```

When a user wants to perform calculations using different from the default settings, the `OPTS` structure should be used:

```matlab
>> opts.maxevals = 50;       % Maximal number of function evaluations
>> opts.maxits = 100;        % Maximal number of iterations
>> opts.testflag = 1;        % 1 if global minima is known, 0 otherwise
>> opts.tol = 0.01;          % Tolerance for termination if testflag = 1
```

Now we are ready to call the dynamic data structure based *PLOR* implementation `dPlor.m` to solve this problem:

```matlab
>> [f_min, x_min, history] = dPlor(P, OPTS);
```

The iterative output stored in the history parameter contains the following information:

```matlab
>> history
        history =
            1.0000        5.0000       16.7833       0.0023
            2.0000        7.0000       16.7833       0.0030
            3.0000       13.0000        5.6500       0.0039
            4.0000       19.0000        5.6500       0.0046
            5.0000       27.0000        1.9537       0.0053
            6.0000       33.0000        1.9537       0.0060
            7.0000       41.0000        0.7167       0.0070
            8.0000       47.0000        0.7167       0.0077
            9.0000       55.0000        0.3060       0.0086
```

Here, the first column shows the iteration number, while the second is the total number of function evaluations. The third column shows how the best objective function value improves at each iteration, while the last column shows the execution time in seconds. The *PLOR* algorithm was terminated when the maximum number of function evaluations (opts.maxevals = 50) exceeded.
The convergence plot is shown on the right side of Fig. 1, while the left side illustrates the **Bukin6** test function over its domain.

### Example of constrained global optimization algorithm usage

---

Any DIRECT-type algorithmic implementation for constrained global optimization problems can be used, following the same principle presented earlier. For constrained problems, implemented algorithms extract additional information from the functions, such as: the number of inequality constraints; the number of equality constraints; and the constraint functions. Let us take the **G06** problem as an example, which is defined in the following way:

```matlab
function y = G06(x)                           
    if nargin == 0			                      % Extract info from the function
        y.nx = 2;                             % Dimension of the problem
        y.ng = 2;                             % Number of g(x) constraints
        y.nh = 0;                             % Number of h(x) constraints
        xl = [13, 0];
        y.xl = @(i) xl(i);                    % Lower bounds for each variable
        y.xu = @(i) 100;		                  % Upper bounds for each variable
        y.fmin = @(nx) get_fmin(nx);          % Known solution value
        y.xmin = @(nx) get_xmin(nx);          % Known solution point
        y.confun = @(i) G06c(i);              % Constraint functions
        return
    end
    if size(x, 2) > size(x, 1)                % If x is a row transpose to column 
        x = x'; 
    end
    y = (x(1) - 10)^3 + (x(2) - 20)^3;        % Return function value at x
end

function [c, ceq] = G06c( x )
    c(1) = -(x(1) - 5)^2 - (x(2) - 5)^2 + 100;
    c(2) = (x(1) - 6)^2 + (x(2) - 5)^2 - 82.81;
    ceq = [];
end

function fmin = get_fmin(~)
    fmin = -6961.8138751273809248;
end

function xmin = get_xmin(~)
    xmin = [14.0950000002011322; 0.8429607896175201];
end
```

Same as in the previous example the optimization problem is passed to the algorithm as part of a `P` structure. Once again, only one field of the `P` structure is needed:

```matlab
>> P.f = 'G06';
```

Next, assume that the user wants to stop the search as soon as the known solution is found to be within 0.01% error. The structure of `OPTS` in the `MATLAB` command window should be given as follows:

```matlab
>> opts.maxevals = 10000;  % Maximal number of function evaluations
>> opts.maxits = 1000;     % Maximal number of iterations
>> opts.testflag = 1;      % 1 if global minima is known, 0 otherwise
>> opts.tol = 0.01;        % Tolerance for termination if testflag = 1
>> opts.showits = 1;       % Print iteration status
```

The desired algorithm can then be run using the following sequence:

```matlab
>> [f_min, x_min, history] = dDirect_GLc(P, OPTS);
```

Since `opts.showits` has been set to 1 in the `OPTS` structure, the status of each iteration will be printed in the `MATLAB` command window. The *DIRECT-GLc* algorithm used in this example works in two phases. Since the initial sampling points of the `G06` problem do not satisfy the constraints using *DIRECT-GLc*, the algorithm switches to the second phase, which is indicated by the first printed line. In the latter phase, the algorithm searches for at least one point where the constraints are satisfied. When the algorithm finds such a point, it switches to phase one and continues trying to find a better solution using the auxiliary function based approach. The last line prints the reason for stopping the algorithm. Since the solution was found with a 0.01% error, the algorithm stopped at iteration 14 after finding the solution ùëìmin with the value ‚àí6901.5099081387.

```

Let us consider a different way in which a user can use DIRECT-type algorithms. If the user wants to solve new problems that are not available in **DIRECTGOLib** without defining the functions as described in earlier, this can be done in other ways. Let us take the same `G06` problem as an example. To the structure `P.f`, the name of an m-file which should compute the value of the `G06` objective function must be given.

```matlab
function y = G06(x)
    y = (x(1) - 10)^3 + (x(2) - 20)^3;
end
```

To the structure `P.constraint`, the name of an m-file which should compute the vector of the **G06** constrain functions must be given.

```matlab
function [c, ceq] = G06c(x)
    c(1) = -(x(1) - 5)^2 - (x(2) - 5)^2 + 100;
    c(2) = (x(1) - 6)^2 + (x(2) - 5)^2 - 82.81;
    ceq = [];
end
```

After the objective and constraint functions are passed to the structure `P`:

```matlab
>> P.f = 'G06';
>> P.constraint = 'G06c';
```

The next necessary parameter to be passed is the optimization domain `D`. `G06` is a second dimension test problem, and domain `D` should look like a 2x2 matrix:

```matlab
>> D = [13, 100; 0, 100];
```

The first column should indicate the lower bounds for `x`, and the second column the upper bounds. Next, assume that we going to use the same `OPTS` structure, which we already defined earlier. However, for the algorithm to find a solution with the desired 0.01% error, it needs to specify the solution of the `G06` problem in the `OPTS` structure.

```matlab
>> opts.globalmin = -6961.81387512; % Known global solution value
```

Then, the desired algorithm can be used with the following sequence:

```matlab
>> [f_min, x_min, history] = dDirect_GLc(P, OPTS, D);
```

This results in the same iterative sequence of the algorithm as in the previous example in this section. The *DIRECT-GLc* algorithm will terminate after 14 iterations and 1027 evaluations of the objective function.

**Parallel algorithm usage**

This section briefly explains how to use parallel versions of the algorithms. Assume a user wishes to use parallel code for the *PLOR* algorithm. First, a parallel implementation of the *PLOR* algorithm `parallel_dPlor.m` should be chosen. Next, a user should specify the number of workers (computational threads). For parallel *PLOR*, it is reasonable to select 2, as only two potential optimal hyper-rectangles are selected per iteration. In this case, `MATLAB` parallel pool size should be specified using the `parpool` command, after which the parallel algorithm should be executed:

```matlab
>> parpool(2);
>> [f_min, x_min, history] = parallel_dPlor(P, OPTS);
```

By default, the `parpool` command starts the `MATLAB` pool on the local machine with one worker per physical CPU core. Using `parpool(2)`, we limit the number of workers to 2. After this, the parallel code is executed using both workers. However, it should be taken into account that creating parallel `parpool` takes some time. Therefore, using the parallel *PLOR* algorithm is inefficient in solving simple problems. The use of parallel codes should address higher-dimensionality, more expensive optimization problems. When all necessary calculations in parallel mode are finished, the following command:

```matlab
>> delete(gcp);
```

shuts down the parallel pool.
