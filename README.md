# DGO
DGO: A new DIRECT-type MATLAB toolbox for derivative-free global optimization

---

The sequential and parallel implementations of various DIRECT-type algorithms. The toolbox consists of two main parts:

- **DGO.mltbx** - MATLAB toolbox package containing implementations of DIRECT-type algorithms, including an extensive DIRECTlib library of the box and generally constrained test and practical engineering global optimization problems, often used for benchmarking DIRECT-type algorithms.
- **DGO.mlappinstall** - A single MATLAB app installer Ô¨Åle containing everything necessary to install and run the DGO toolbox, including a graphical user interface (GUI).

Additionally, we provide source files of all implemented algorithms and test problems in a separate forlders, **DIRECT-type algorithms/** and **DIRECTLib/**.
